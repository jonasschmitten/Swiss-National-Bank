## About the paper
In this study we analyzed what variables define safe haven periods. In particular, we explored how the Swiss franc is affected and differs from other safe haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and across different base currencies. Furthermore, we analyzed if patterns persist over time and if there exist early warning indicators to predict a regime switch. To characterize states, we use a Gaussian Mixture model with factor models on the partitioned data. We find that the Swiss franc exhibits safe haven properties relative to various currencies, both on average and during crisis. Especially an increase in risk factors such as the VSTOXX, Gold, and Global FX Volatility lead to an appreciation of the franc. The effects are non-linear in crisis and non-crisis periods, with a stronger effect in crisis periods. While the Japanese yen appears to be a safer currency with increasing FX volatility and increasing yields on sub-investment grade US corporate bonds, the franc has a strong link to gold. Moreover, we find that the safe haven status of the franc has changed since the SNB removed the CHF/EUR floor in early 2015. We observe more noise which makes it harder to classify whether an appreciation of the Swiss franc is a result of safe haven refuge. Switzerland’s safe haven status has ramifications for the SNB in that the appreciation causes downward pressure on prices and dampens the business cycle due to Switzerland’s high export dependency. A particular cause for concern would be uncertainty in Europe due to the particular sensitivity of the CHF/EUR spot rate to increases in risk and Europe being Switzerland’s largest trading partner. The interventions of the SNB may have reduced the reverse peso problem as the franc no longer provides an attractive insurance against crises.
